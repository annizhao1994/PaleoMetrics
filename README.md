# PaleoMetrics
## See summary,csv for information

### Files
1. Figure 1.xlsx contains all data
2. csvfiles folder contains the files used in plotting.
3. color_information.csv contains the defined colors for individual models

### Notebooks:
1. Figure1_global_mean_temperature_anomaly(Figure7.19).ipynb
2. Box TS.2, Figure 2.ipynb

### Things need to do/confirm:
For Figure 1:
1. Do we want to include Lunt et al. (2013) LIG and Lunt et al. (2012) EoMIP?
2. Do we want to mark models by different colors? If so, I need to rename models in mPWP and EECO files.
I need to check obervation values.
I need to check ECS values.
